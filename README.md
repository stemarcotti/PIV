## PIV documentation

Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) package developed in the Stramer Lab (King's College London, UK). Please check [our publication on Nature Cell Biology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-019-0411-5) for more details ([release v1.0](https://github.com/stemarcotti/PIV/releases)).

An introduction to the software and a live demonstration can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwHozdoo7Sw), in a recorded talk of the SORSE (Series of Online Research Software Events) series.

Tested on MATLAB v2018B. The Curve Fitting Toolbox is required.

This PIV code comes without a graphic user interface (GUI) and should be run in MATLAB as a script (open .m file and hit Run). It is used as follow.
See [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867415001816?via%3Dihub#app2) for further references.

### 1. Image pre-processing
Segmented stacks of biological samples to be analysed should be pre-processed as follows:

1. Open stack in ImageJ
2. Split channels (e.g. green - actin, magenta - nucleus)
3. Save channel containing the entity to be measured by PIV (e.g. green - actin) as **[cb#\_m.tif]**, where cb stands for cell body, # is a progressive integer number, and m stands for moving
4. Save channel containing the entity used for tracking (e.g. magenta - nucleus) as **[n#_m.tif]**
5. If working with cells, segment out the cell body from the entity to be measured by PIV (e.g. green - actin) and save this one-channel stack as **[no_cb#\_m.tif]** (no cell body). This is needed for the **[eroded_heatmap.m]** script (see below).
6. Store **[cb#\_m.tif]**, **[n#_m.tif]** and **[no_cb#\_m.tif]** in a folder (e.g. _[cell1]_), where the PIV output is going to be saved

### 2. PIV
Clone this repository locally in your machine. Make sure the MATLAB folder in which you set your environment contains the following scripts: **[happy_piv.m]**, **[run_piv.m]**, **[create_retro_flow_image.m]**, **[detectObjectBw.m]**, **[generate_plot_normalized.m]** and, if needed, **[eroded_heatmap.m]**.

To run the PIV follow these instructions:

1. Run **[happy_piv.m]**
  - input requested to the user:
    + stack of the entity to be measured by PIV **[cb#\_m.tif]**
    + name for the output stamp to be appended to all saved output files (e.g. [output_name]: cell1)
    + PIV parameters:
      - _Source size [um]_: size of the region of interest (ROI) to be tracked in the next frame [um]
      - _Search size [um]_: size of the region to be used in the next frame for searching the ROI [um]
      - _Grid distance [um]_: grid spacing for ROI mapping [um]
      - _Correlation threshold [-]_
      - _Pixel size [um]_: image calibration of the loaded movie (length of a pixel in [um])
      - _Frame interval [s]_: time calibration of the loaded movie (frame interval in [s])
      - _Frame rate to be analysed [-]_: interval of frames of the loaded movie to be analysed (if 1: all the frames will be analysed, if 2: every other frame, and so on)
      - _Max number of frames to be analysed [frames]_ : maximum number of frames to be analysed (the default value displays the total available frames, do not change if wanting to analyse the whole movie)
    + Interpolation parameters (only prompted if interpolation is requested):
      - _Spatial kernel size [um]_: size of the spatial Gaussian kernel for interpolation
      - _Spatial kernel sigma [um]_: sigma (variance) of the spatial Gaussian kernel for interpolation
      - _Max flow velocity to be displayed in colourmap [um/min]_: upper limit of colour map in [um/min] for the heatmap
      - _Flow field arrow distance [um]_: distance of the arrow showing the vector field in the heatmap [um]
  - if parameters need to be optimised it is possible to show the frame correlation for a single frame, by hitting _Yes_ when prompted with the relevant question _"Do you want to test frame correlation to adjust the parameters?"_. This can be done multiple times, until the user doesn't reply _Yes_ to the following question _"Are you happy with the frame correlation test?"_.
  - Once the parameters are set, the PIV on all frames can be run by hitting _No_ when prompted with the question _"Do you want to test frame correlation to adjust the parameters?"_. The parameters are saved in the folder [parameters] which can be found where the loaded movie is stored (e.g. _[cell1]_).
  - The first phase of the PIV works out the raw vector fields in [um/min], which is visually displayed for each frame. The stack (**[piv_raw_(output_name).tif]**) and the numerical data (**[piv_field_raw_(output_name).mat]**) are saved in the folder [images] and [data] respectively. Both folders can be found where the loaded movie is stored (e.g. _[cell1]_).
  - The second phase of the PIV interpolates the raw vector fields to obtained the interpolated field heatmap in [um/min], which is visually displayed for each frame. This second part is optional, and will be run only if the user answer _Yes_ when prompted with the question _"Do you want to interpolate the vector field?"_. The spatial kernel parameters are chosen by the user, while the temporal kernel interpolates within 5 frames as default. The stack (**[piv_interpolated_(output_name).tif]**) and the numerical data (**[piv_field_interpolated_(output_name).mat]**) are saved in the folder [images] and [data] respectively.  

2. More refined interpolated heatmaps can be obtained by running the **[eroded_heatmap.m]** script
  - input requested to the user:
    + folder containing **[cb#\_m.tif]**, **[no_cb#\_m.tif]** and PIV output (e.g. _[cell1]_). If working with cell images for which the **[no_cb#\_m.tif]** is available, the final heatmaps will not show overlayed vectors for this area. If the file **[no_cb#\_m.tif]** does not exist, the heatmap will display the original entity in full.
    + name for the output stamp to be appended to all saved output files (e.g. [output_name]: cell1); need to be the same assigned when running **[happy_piv.m]**!
    + the movie ID (# in **[cb#\_m.tif]** and **[no_cb#\_m.tif]**)
  - this script returns the refined stack (**[piv_field_interpolated_eroded_(output_name).tif]**), containing the heatmaps of the interpolated PIV field overlayed with the flow vectors (excluded the cell body if applicable).
